I feel as if in the “maybe” position. I am not “on” or “off” – the folly Pavlovian mechanism. I am the in-between esisenstate. The fnord, if you will.

Doubt must be forced to the side. Will must overcome doubt. Only I shall remain.

We cannot see our futures. We cannot see what will become of this wheel.  
We become.  
We are.  
We are something.

<p style="text-align:center;">I will become. We shall become one. O! We are father and mother.</p>

I bind you in this area, <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Mars</span>. You are bound by love. My love for Her. I will become fulfilled by Her. We will fulfill. We will be unbroken.

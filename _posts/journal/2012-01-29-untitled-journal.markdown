I fear that the only way to be saved is the total destruction of my reality matrix.  My reality will become a toy – and my mind a tool…to explore this playground and fuck everything up.

Shaman. Human. Immortal. Vessel. Angel.

Siva. Destruction for creation. Disintegration to love.

Basically, I want to take my brain and beat it to shit. These circuits restricting me must be destroyed and rebuilt with better intentions than those who came before and conquered.

I must stop creating this circuit of selfishness and sloth. The programming has begun. The code strings are now ready to be put into place.

<p style="text-align:center;" markdown="1">This is debugging mode.</p>

So the perception/opinion must be modified to realize the program and reform the data to useful outlets. I have been reading the manuals, but now it is time to take control.

No excuses.

Weakness of spirit will not be tolerated.

**Destroy** the flimsy ego so that HGA can rise as the Phoenix. Aether!

The holy goal, the holy light, the holy calling. Divinity! Hurrah!

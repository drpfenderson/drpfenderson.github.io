Indra’s net expands outward – constantly pushing the limitations of connection in the universe. The boundaries are infinite, yet elastic. Shining jewels flash light at every point of this net. Every intersection holds the promise of a new universe.

Here are our words. The flawed conveyor of information – the material composing this blessed net. Can the simplicity of these marred building blocks really be the key to expanding the net?

Where is the godhead in this? Perhaps there is some aspect of our experience in this information net that is the godhead. The face behind the characters forms the net. The soul is the jewel. Or, our experience – the connection we have and the experiences we share – is the intersection and the light the refracts outward along the lines on the net.

The totality of the net is Thee Shard. And so a shard is one sliver of this total experience. But as a shard, it acts as DNA. It contains a map of all connections that lead to its intersection.

So, shards are the gems – the lights. The singularities that form in our interactions is Thee Shard! Rather than a single unit of information, it is instead the connection we form to breed information. So, to extend the net we much connect (shard) with the other singularities in order to grow rather than fuck around with our language.

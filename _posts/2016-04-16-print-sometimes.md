![An old lawn chair in the woods, decrepit and covered in leaves]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/lawn-chair-1148974.jpg)

Sometimes I look behind the vinyl chairs before I sit down

not trusting that something might not be there  
like treasure chests filled with apathy  
or cookie jars – or matrimony  
I let this wall come in to play  
as if, in my deluded mind, it would not be expected to hear the voices  
the heads bowed, cloakfacedarkness{}peaceunderstand, o O O O 1

movement two  
hush now  
breathe in quickly fire breath displace  
the snake circuit mandala oroborus  
the breath fire balancing him  
aPathy .a. NO! Out

circle the three  
hail jörmungandr hail eris  
w(ishing)(ashing)(orn)(retched)

Don’t think badly of me, it is not my fault that the circle comes this way  
you saw the end and then the wheel turned over and here we are again  
remember the past forget the now creating the future  
and reverse  
reverse and  
creating the every single tiny droplet of blessed light this god this circle this spiral

cthon – aha! BLISS|SSILB !aha – here we are again at the beginning of our lives the beginning of the none   the circle the circling drainspirals upward bringing us up the elevator  
top floor Please? Please center yourself, good sir. Be kind enough to love every thought arising from that   coiled serpent.

It will be good,  
It shall be so  
So say we all  
HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!

And you were beginning to believe me.

You mustn’t  
Believe me  
in the beginning which is the end which is  
.believe me.  
Here comes the puzzle here comes the edge REACH! AND THERE!

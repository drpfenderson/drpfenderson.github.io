Remember the sundry trinkets and goodies  
that you emptied into the bowl beside your bed  
and lay to sleep as coins, fuzz, and lost secrets  
rolled around in ceramic haven while your mind  
brumbled around in secret sleeping bliss?

Here I lie at the bottom, sandy and forgotten  
a series of shiny beach pebbles and shells  
found on darkened beaches that poets roam  
and lonely mistresses comb for lost dreams,  
remedies to their ills, and companions

Sitting beside the shards of precious stones you left,  
the dry tongues that speak no more â€“ once promised  
to speak a language together but alone  
while reading tales of hidden civilizations as our own  
is born

Paper clips block the light as sun streams through shade  
and you stir to conquer more sky and heart today,  
your movement stirring the feathers here plucked  
from the earth to remind us how we still fly, or  
woven in our hair to carry us aloft, borne on light  

These words are not the first that spilled  
the tale of forfeit and fancy  
but here they stay to star and sound the life  
that can no longer flow forth  
and vines will grow to cover  
and rest always

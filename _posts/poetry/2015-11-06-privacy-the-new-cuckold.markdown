excerpt: "In the one pale beam
cast across cracked and
lonely planks, still tender from
the touch of quiet carpentry
the (e)motes float and cavort
One blink
and not even the brazen sun
can re-move them"

<p align="center">In the one pale beam  
cast across cracked and  
lonely planks, still tender from  
the touch of quiet carpentry  
the (e)motes float and cavort  
One blink  
and not even the brazen sun  
can re-move them  
to dance their fortunes  
splayed for all to see  
and make privacy the biggest  
cuckold you ever did know</p>

<p align="center">If lucid thought be that  
which you seek  
then spinning and tumble-dry  
dusky corpses of memories  
lost to murky sights  
and lidded carpet rooms  
are all that will greet you</p>

<p align="center">Trace these patterns into the surface  
of your harlequin glassed eyeview  
and watch as rainbow-scented  
photon gods reveal your  
for(tune) to shimmy to  
to hornpipe to  
smoke in your  
vision  
obscure</p>

<p align="center">But only a washtub made for  
feelings wrought of iron  
which has made a truce with  
King Poisidin for safe passage  
can  travel to the other side  
into tomorrow morning  
Strange land that our tingled  
and fancies cannot step into  
barred like Eve  
like Adam  
forever trapped outside  
frozen into this cube</p>

Slender trunks, pure white, shimmer and gleam  
ivory towers hold the sky aloft  
swirling motes shining bright  
as tunnel vision locks and entwines under verdant canopy  
Flush with light â€“ shining from every pore  
we inhale the fresh smell of crushed grass  
and gently trace the curve of warmth  
as smooth rocks in the sun, electric and thorough  
in their magnificence

Twin serpents vibrant  
blinding at their base to form  
helix treasure from sky of old  
to bond to fuse to bite to burn  
So now, to sheath this holy Word  
as we move and vibrate swift  
in the quiet comfort of a world  
between sheets and sky  

Goddess; to rain splendor down  
upon my brow, and sweep eyeless medicine  
a(n)side the cube fast spinning  
quarter to zero to one and none  
else to see this unbroken wonder

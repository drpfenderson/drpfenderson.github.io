Boiling, bubbling  
Silken strands burst forth from the calm and  
steady surface  
They reach out to embrace the minds that cannot  
free themselves in the mirror,  
sinking softly – softly now into the fertile soil  
Wordseeds, shells shocked after lifelike journeys  
into the whirled cord,  
death spasms bringing rolling wavewalls  
to challenge, to scorn  
Alight! fast vanish  
Illumination! to bring steps upward tumbledown  
Twixt and timber, rent asunder

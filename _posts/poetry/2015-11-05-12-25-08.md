Tiny pyramids [cover the dream chart I have graphed](http://xkcd.com/518/)  
with information [flowing and bouncing  
full of self-fulfilling spiral madness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_Dynamics)  
and [manic spitfire binary tappings  
morsing](http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/13/news/mn-14540) out a [cacophonous tympani  
ancient drums](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXfYsJplrc0) [relaying the multilayered filaments  
with photon flashing](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980dsn..nasa...63M), reflected in your eyes  
I see the in.sight that comes from somewhere  
in this [whirling maw of nodes and numbers](http://www.timboucher.com/journal/2008/12/10/microversal-converters/)  
far-flung in six holographic dimensions â€“  
a certain upgrade from [the sparkled glasses of old  
that only let us see blank canvases half-cocked](http://www.timboucher.com/journal/2008/12/16/many-lenses-focusing-a-vision-of-the-internets-future-photo-essay/)  
and [crammed with scrolling messages impending  
doom](http://community.livejournal.com/suggestions/359021.html)  
Reach through the fired sand turned mirror and  
sprinkle your [own shining glyph onto the glowing mandala](http://www.timboucher.com/journal/2008/12/16/announcing-mandala-os-kaleidoscope-browser-data-visualization/)  
sphere-charm  
[tossing seeds of crystal walls](http://www.timboucher.com/journal/2008/12/20/detect-context-automatically-traversing-reference-point-nodes-associative-search/) into the face of  
cloaked eraserheads  
forcing dissolution of [walled spendor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walled_garden_%28media%29) into  
novae and [opened plane outreaching](http://openid.net/what/)  
off into the distant stars`

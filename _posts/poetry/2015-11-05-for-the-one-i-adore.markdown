A light illuminating dances  
a spark falling touching upturned face  
brightening where once none was found  
in darkness peril upheaval canceled by true love  
A star most treasured high above  
the beauty that I see.k  
and when near my breath revoked  
into the pure life you give  
Ambrosia that I taste  
from lips of this goddess  
which sustains me/y soul  

And thus I am lifted  
and thusly I am saved

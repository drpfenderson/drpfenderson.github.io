Air surrounding me leeches away the words  
that should be whispered close on winter  
nights such as these –  
is it ever as difficult as it seems?  
That these fluttering mouthbites will never  
make it to the shells that they were meant for  
but instead shall scoot around in houses too small

The surface of the bubble is sometimes too thick  
to push through; all the puncturepuncturepuncture  
of days past close over and channels disappear,  
their blankets pulled over their heads to keep warm  
and shut the light from coming  
Only faint and dainty  
wisps  
of smoke give tell to the smoldering ember  
that sits enshrined in a glass case/stone basement,  
held back by knots in the soft tunnel,  
bundled behind the memory of too many “naughts”  
and not enough patience – and only pale imitations  
remain

manifold  
mantisfold bowing head in  
pra(e)yer  
dining on our mind treat-tasties like toffee bites and peppermint schnapps on Christ-mass morn

Arboreal insect road-hive-mind  
Epoxy melody planting roots in my brain-stem  
exploding globule modules of code  
executing jumps of time/space/cube  

The numbers have changed  
the change has shifted hands  
Changing method-rhythm to beating tribal drum harmony  
blue ceiling crushing down stretched so thin

And we shall all break/brake through womb-state and mother collar to rise to light to path to pose

This braille-rosetta only the numb can follow  
gating the sacred garden (by chance, of course)  
Not one planned this plane

but all will see it all will slay it  
and you shall be it  
so, free it
